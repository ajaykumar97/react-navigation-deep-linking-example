//The app is configured to accept and handle deep linking. To test it run the following command:

# iOS
xcrun simctl openurl booted exp://127.0.0.1:19000/--/details/3

# Android
adb shell am start -W -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d "exp://127.0.0.1:19000/--/details/3"

//If not using expo, or it's a live app, it would look like:

# iOS
xcrun simctl openurl booted swapi://details/3

# Android
adb shell am start -W -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d "swapi://details/3"
